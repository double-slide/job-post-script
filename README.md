After spending so much time in VS code during bootcamp, feeling the need to flex some basic linux muscles again. 

Objectives of this quick project:
- use bash script to automate the repeated checking of job posting websites
- ideally use separate files (CSV? something else?) for URLS to check, as well as keywords to cross-reference
- code must be written in VIM, and using a single terminal window (TMUX for the multi-pane)
