After spending so much time in VS code during bootcamp, feeling the need to flex some linux muscles again. 

Objectives of this quick project:
- use bash script to automate the repeated checking of job posting websites
- ideally use separate files (CSV?) for URLS to check, and keywords to cross-reference
- code must be written in VIM, and using a single terminal window (tmux for multi-pane)
